Contributing to the degradation of the service tee and insert were significantly elevated ground temperatures from steam escaping R.M.

Contributing to the crash were the failure of the truck motor carrier, Aero Global Logistics (AGL), to effectively manage driver fatigue and monitor unsafe driving, and the failure of the bus motor carrier, LBFNY, to operate in compliance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and a federal out-of-service order. Also contributing was the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's ineffective oversight of AGL during the New Entrant Safety Assurance Program and subsequent compliance reviews to ensure that the carrier had appropriate safety management controls in place to mitigate its high crash rate and driver fatigue.

Contributing to the accident were (1) Saab's design of the wheel speed transducer wire harnesses, which did not consider and protect against human error during maintenance; (2) the Federal Aviation Administration's lack of consideration of the runway safety area dimensions at Unalaska Airport during the authorization process that allowed the Saab 2000 to operate at the airport; and (3) the flight crewmembers' inappropriate decision, due to their plan continuation bias, to land on a runway with a reported tailwind that exceeded the airplane manufacturer's limit. The safety margin was further reduced because of PenAir's failure to correctly apply its company-designated pilot-in\u0002-command airport qualification policy, which allowed the accident captain to operate at one of the most challenging airports in PenAir's route system with limited experience at the airport and in the Saab 2000 airplane."

The inadequate design of the disk resulted in a high stress area in the blade slot bottom aft corner that was at or nearly at the material's capability so that there was no damage tolerance such that a small dent could cause a crack to initiate and propagate to failure. Contributing to the disk's failure was the FAA's failure to mandate an accelerated inspection schedule after a previous CF6-80A uncontained HPT stage 1 disk failure had occurred and after other CF6-80A HPT disks had been found during routine overhaul to have cracks in the blade slot bottom aft corners."

CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: INADEQUATE PROCEDURES USED BY EVERGREEN AIRLINES AND APPROVED BY THE FAA FOR PREFLIGHT VERIFICATION OF CARGO DOOR SECURITY, EVERGREEN'S FAILURE TO MARK PROPERLY THE AIRPLANE'S EXTERNAL CARGO DOOR LOCKPIN MANUAL CONTROL HANDLE, AND THE FAILURE OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS TO PROVIDE FLIGHTCREW GUIDANCE AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES FOR AN INFLIGHT OPENING OF THE CARGO DOOR. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE FAILURE OF THE FAA TO MANDATE MODIFICATION TO THE DOOR-OPEN WARNING SYSTEM FOR DC-9 CARGO-CONFIGURED AIRPLANES, GIVEN THE PREVIOUS KNOWN OCCURRENCES OF INFLIGHT DOOR OPENINGS."

CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS DELTA'S SLOW IMPLEMENTATION OF NECESSARY MODIFICATIONS TO ITS OPERATING PROCEDURES, MANUAL'S, CHECKLISTS, TRAINING, AND CREW CHECKING PROGRAMS WHICH WERE NECESSITATED BY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE AIRLINE FOLLOWING RAPID GROWTH AND MERGER.
